Our maps are based on results from a dialect survey that has been running for many years. The project started out as fieldwork undertaken by students of Linguistics and English Language at the University of Manchester. As part of their coursework for the module Language Variation and Change, these students investigated the linguistic diversity present in British English by asking their friends and family to complete a questionnaire. {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="/img/questionnaire.png" target="_blank">You can see a sample of one of the early questionnaires here</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}. 

Since then, our work has grown into a much larger project and we have continued to collect data from various other universities and from the wider population. Over 14,000 English speakers have participated in our study since its inception in 2013: they range in age from 10 to 89 and span a geographical region from Lewis to Cornwall.

[Laurel MacKenzie](http://www.laurelmackenzie.com/), [George Bailey](https://www.gbailey.uk/), and [Danielle Turton](https://danielleturton.rbind.io/) have published some results from this research in the Journal of Linguistic Geography in an article titled 'Towards an updated dialect atlas of British English', which you can read [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-linguistic-geography/article/towards-an-updated-dialect-atlas-of-british-english/07AD1E071645452F33A118B08E038CD6). Various other publications based on this dialect data are in the pipeline, so watch this space!
