#### Previous findings
There is no published literature on this particular case of lexical variation.

#### Our findings
It seems that all four of these lexical choices are used freely throughout the UK, with the situation in the North being particularly diverse as the four terms are used fairly equally here. There is only one obvious dialectal preference: _yous_ is predominant in the North, particularly the North East (where 51\% of speakers use it), as well as Northern Ireland (69\%), but is barely attested in the South (2\%).
