#### Previous findings
The use of _dinner_ or _tea_ is often employed as a prime example of England’s North-South division. The Oxford English Dictionary lists _tea_ as “a light meal in the late afternoon, but locally in the U.K. (esp. northern), […] a cooked evening meal” (OED 2013), which suggests that _tea_ is indeed a Northern form.

#### Our findings
This variable shows clear regional stratification. _Tea_ is evidently favourable in the North, with _dinner_ predominant in the South. London in particular shows a huge contrast: 89% favour _dinner_ compared to the mere 3% that favour _tea_.
