#### Previous findings
There is no published literature on this particular case of lexical variation.

#### Our findings
_Sofa_ is the preferred variant throughout the UK, followed by _settee_, and finally _couch_. However, there is variation in the degree to which this variant is preferred in each of these major regions. _Sofa_ is most predominant in the South where it is used by 79% of speakers, whereas in the North we find a much more even distribution between the three variants. _Couch_ in particular shows a high concentration in the North West, where it is used by 32\% of our respondents, as well as in Scotland (42\%).
