#### Previous findings
A previous study by Szmrecsanyi revealed that this irregular past tense form is frequently found in the Southern regions of England; past tense _done_ is a particularly southern feature that becomes less frequent as one progresses north (2013: 55).

#### Our findings
46% of southern speakers either use this construction themselves, or frequently hear it in their area. Despite research from Szmrecsanyi (2013) that suggests otherwise, this figure is actually smaller than that for northern speakers (56%); this indicates that _I done it_ is, if anything, a northern feature. However, the difference between the two regions can hardly be described as substantial.
