#### Previous findings
There is no published literature on this particular case of lexical variation.

#### Our findings
Once again there isnâ€™t much variation outside the North, with a predominance of _alley/alleyway_. Within the Midlands and the North, the other variants form a few clear patterns, such as _ginnel_ around Greater Manchester and Leeds, _entry_ around Merseyside, and _gennel_ around Sheffield. Just south of Sheffield, there are a cluster of _jitty_-users around Derby and Chesterfield. Interestingly, there are other sharp regional divides present in the North too: notice the pocket of _snicket_ responses around Bradford despite its close proximity to _ginnel_-favouring Leeds.
