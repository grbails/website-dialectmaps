#### Previous findings
According to Wells, words like _book_ and _cook_ retain the long vowel /uː/ in northern regions of the UK (1982: 362). That is, speakers rhyme _book_ with _spook_ in these regions. However, this is now recessive, and in much of the UK both words are pronounced with the shorter /ʊ/ vowel.

#### Our findings
There is an expected increase in _book-spook_ rhyming in the North (18% compared to 8% in the South), but an overall majority of speakers throughout England don't rhyme these words, with a shorter vowel in _book_. The North East contains a much larger proportion of _book-spook_ rhymers than elsewhere in England (around 50% of speakers); rhyming is also characteristic of our respondents from Scotland (74%) and Northern Ireland (90%).
