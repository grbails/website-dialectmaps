#### Previous findings
Whilst there is no academic work on the variation between ice lolly and lolly ice, [newspaper reports](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/lolly-ice-ice-lolly-great-3337667) have previously attested the use of lolly ice in Merseyside.

#### Our findings
Our map shows that despite a clear predominance of _ice lolly_ throughout the UK, there is a notable cluster of _lolly ice_ users in the North West, specifically Merseyside and even spreading to nearby regions across the England/Wales border near Cheshire. Among the North Western respondents in our survey, _lolly ice_ is used by 57\% of those with an 'L' postcode and 51\% of those with a 'CH' postcode, compared to just 3\% for all other postcode areas in the North West.
