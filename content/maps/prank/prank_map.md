#### Previous findings
There is no published literature on this particular case of lexical variation.

#### Our findings
There is a clear North-South divide with respect to this case of lexical variation, where _knock and run_ and other related terms (e.g. _knock-a-door run_, _knock knock run_) are favoured in the North and Midlands, and _knock knock ginger_ and other members of the ginger family are favoured in the South. Two other terms, though they appear much less frequently, also show clear regional patterning: cherry knocking is clustered in a southern region of the Midlands, while nicky nicky nine doors seems to be restricted to the North East.
