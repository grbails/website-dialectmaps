#### Previous findings
There is no published literature on this particular case of lexical variation.

#### Our findings
_Trousers_ is by far the most popular lexical choice, with over three times the number of responses than _pants_. It is widespread throughout the whole country, although the strong preference for this lexical choice is weakened somewhat in the North, particularly the North West. It becomes clear that _pants_ is a strictly northern term when one looks at the variation in the North West in particular, where 49% of speakers use _pants_. In the South of England, this figure drops to a strikingly low 3%.
