#### Previous findings
There is no published literature on this particular case of lexical variation. 

#### Our findings
_Pumps_ and _plimsolls_ are by far the most popular choices, making up a massive 97% of responses. _Pumps_ is more widespread throughout the UK, but shows clear prominence in the North, whereas _plimsolls_ is favoured in the South. _Daps_ is an interesting lexical choice, as it shows a very specific concentration in the South West (including the southern coastline of Wales). Bristol and Cardiff, on either side of the Bristol Channel, seem to be two hot spots for this word. This likely stems from the fact that the Dunlop Athletic Plimsoles (DAP) factory was based in Bristol; itâ€™s possible that the general term _daps_ emerged from this brand name.
