#### Previous findings
Hughes et al. note that _give it me_ is very common in the "speech of people from the North", but also "quite acceptable to many Southern speakers" (2012: 20).

#### Our findings
The striking concentration of green points in the North West supports Hughes et al. (2012); _give it me_ is clearly a feature of Northern dialects, although this does not appear to extend to speakers from Tyneside in the North East. The grouping of yellow points in and around London suggests that this instance of syntactic variation does indeed show a North-South divide.
