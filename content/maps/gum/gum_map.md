#### Previous findings
There is no published literature on this particular case of lexical variation.

#### Our findings
Although _chewing gum_ is clearly prevalent throughout the whole of the United Kingdom, there are some clear regional patterns that indicate more lexical variation in the North than in the South. 97% of southern speakers use _chewing gum_, and the other variants are almost totally absent. In the North, however, there are clear clusters of _chewy_ around Merseyside and Middlesbrough, _chuddy_ around Greater Manchester and Leeds, and a suggestion that _chud_ is somewhat more common in Tyneside.
