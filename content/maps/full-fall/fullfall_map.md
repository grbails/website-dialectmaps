#### Previous findings
Hughes et al. propose that, given its intermediate location between the South West and South East, Southampton features an accent with very distinctive Southern qualities; this is expressed by, amongst other things, a neutralisation of vowels preceding the consonant /l/ (2012: 90). This leads to words like _fool_, _full_ and _fall_ all possessing the same vowel and therefore being homophonous in this accent.

#### Our findings
Other than a few speakers dotted around Sheffield and Mansfield just to the south, _full_-_fall_ homophony is not an obvious feature of any accent. Despite Hughes et al.’s (2012) grouping _fool_, _full_ and _fall_ together, they seem to be distributed slightly differently throughout the UK. Contrary to what was found with _fool_-_full_, _full_-_fall_ homophony isn’t present at all in Northern Ireland, and only with one speaker in Scotland.
