#### Previous findings
According to Hughes et al., the pronunciation of _poor_ with the vowel /ɔː/ instead of traditional /ʊə/ has become increasingly common, leading to homophony with words like _pour_ and _pore_ (2012: 50). Hughes et al. do not offer any insight into the geographical distribution of speakers with this pronunciation, which suggests that it is quite widespread throughout the UK.

#### Our findings
Homophony between _pour_ and _poor_ is clearly predominant throughout England, with the only exception being the North East, where only 34% pronounce the words the same (compare this with the 85% figure for the UK as a whole). The difference is even starker in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the words are prounced the same for only 27% and 18% of speakers, respectively. There are less obvious pockets of speakers in Cumbria and just north of Sheffield who also pronounce these words differently.
