#### Previous findings
Use of _was_ with the pronoun _you_ (as opposed to the standard form _were_) has been documented throughout England. Based on most recent work, it appears to be receding from the South, where it was once widely attested (Britain 2002: 20).

#### Our findings
This construction is favoured in the North of England, where 73% of respondents either use this form or have heard it used locally; a comparable figure is also found in the Midlands (72%). The proportion of speakers who hear/use this form in other dialect regions is much lower (53% in Wales, 49% in the South, 24% in Northern Ireland, and just 9% in Scotland).
