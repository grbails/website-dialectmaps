#### Previous findings
There is no published literature on this particular case of lexical variation. 

#### Our findings
Our data shows clear regional patterns for this particular case of lexical variation. _Barm_ is confined to the North West, comprising an area that runs from Manchester westward to Liverpool and northward into the western half of Lancashire (from Blackpool to Preston). _Tea cake_ spans the eastern half of Lancashire (Blackburn, Burnley) and the western half of West Yorkshire (Bradford and areas around Leeds). _Bread cake_ is also used in parts of Yorkshire, clustering primarily around the urban centres of Sheffield and Hull. _Muffin_ is perhaps the most geographically localized, confined to East Manchester and areas such as Oldham and Rochdale. _Cob_ is largely concentrated in the Midlands around Nottinghamshire. _Batch_ is used in two very small areas: Liverpool, in the North West, and Coventry, in the West Midlands. _Bap_ is fairly widespread, but is most concentrated in Staffordshire, the West Midlands (Stoke-on-Trent, Birmingham), and North Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Man. _Bun_, similarly, is fairly widespread, but maintains a stronghold in a broad area of the North East, extending from north of Newcastle down to northern Lincolnshire, tracing a diagonal line north of Leeds over to Cumbria. Finally, _roll_ is apparently the normative choice, the most chosen variant and the one with the widest spread across the country, predominating in the South of England and in Scotland. The general picture is of considerable lexical diversity in the North and Midlands, and much more homogeneity in the South.
