#### Previous findings
Wells (1982) states that the most distinctive characteristic of a northern accent is the absence of a rhyme between _class_ and _farce_, which is even more distinctive than [the rhyming of _foot_ and _strut_](/maps/foot-cut/). As such, we might expect to see the North/South divide represented more starkly for _class-farce_ than for _foot-strut_.

#### Our findings
As expected, we find a major divide between the North and South with regard to this variable. At its most extreme, we find 90% of London speakers rhyming the two words, contrasting with a mere 7% of speakers from the North West. In the Midlands, only 25% of speakers associate with the southern tendency to rhyme _class_ and _farce_. This contrasts with the southern tendency of distinguishing _foot_ and _cut_, which is exhibited by 52% of Midlands speakers. This confirms the prediction that it is the rhyming of _class_ and _farce_, not the presence of a _foot-strut_ split, that is most characteristic of the South.
