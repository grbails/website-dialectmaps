#### Previous findings
A previous survey by Wells found that similar word pairs, like _for-four_, tend to rhyme in the south of England most often, but it is becoming increasingly common for other dialects to rhyme such words now as well (1982: 235). [Recent research from Dr Maciej Baranowski](http://mlm.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/resources/manchester-accent-project/variation-and-change-in-manchesters-vowels/the-north-force-merger/) also suggests that a distinction between such word pairs still remains in the northern parts of Manchester.

#### Our findings
Comparable to what Wells (1982) found, the _for-more_ rhyme is found throughout the whole country, with a staggering 87% of UK speakers rhyming the two words. Broken down into regions, there is a preference for _for-more_ rhyming in the South, with 96% speakers compared to the Northâ€™s 82%, but it is clearly predominant in almost all dialects. One exception is found in Manchester, where there are slightly more speakers who distinguish _for_ from _more_ than in the rest of the country (only 66% of those with a Manchester postcode rhyme the two words, and they tend to be concentrated in the south of Manchester). Another exception is Scotland, where just 59% of the 82 respondents claim to rhyme the words.
