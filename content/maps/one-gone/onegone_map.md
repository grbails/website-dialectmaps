#### Previous findings
Wells states that _one_ and _gone_ often rhyme for northern and Midlands speakers, specifically those from Birmingham, Stoke, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield (1982: 362). Elsewhere, _one_ is pronounced with a different vowel, /ʌ/ instead of /ɒ/.

#### Our findings
Our map shows that the _one-gone_ rhyme occurs often in the speech of northerners: 83% to be precise. This contrasts with southern dialect regions, where only 35% of respondents rhyme the words. The rhyme is also predominant in the Midlands (77% of speakers); this high proportion is largely due to, as Wells (1982) also found, the cities of Birmingham and Nottingham.
